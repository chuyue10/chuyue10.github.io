                <p>I am Ria Chu, currently a Junior at Georgia Institute of Technology working towards a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I have had a facination with all things related to robotics and programming ever since I joined my elementary school robotics team. I was interested in making robots, self-driving cars, autonomous rovers, and even fighting robots. </p>
                <p>In my first semester of college, I decided to major in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Automation. Eventually, I discover that I was much more interested in the programming aspect decision making autonomous machines. Following that realization I decidied to change my major to Computer Science with threads Intelligence and Modeling and Simulation.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am a year away from graduating with a Bachelor's Degree. I have a very strong background in Java and the theoretical aspects of Computer Science. In my free time, I like to work on my own projects in different areas of software engineering. Currently, I am experimenting with programming different types of game AI in a small game made in C#.</p>
